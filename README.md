# Memory Card Game

## User Story
Fun little card game based on emojis, that I made as a little side project for some friends. 

Consists of 16 boxes, when one box is clicked it will flip to reveal the emoji, if the next card clicked matches the initial card first open, then they will both remain open. If the next card does not match, then both cards will close, no longer revealing the emojis behind. There is a reset button to randomize the eomji cards in a different order whenever the user desires to, or just simply finds all cards.
